"Q1: Will a person with Type 2 diabetes under control end up with the need for insulin?" = "Q1: Will a person with Type 2 diabetes under control end up with the need for insulin?";
"A: As you may have read, Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease. Will you require insulin? That all depends on individual factors that includes, among many other factors, weight, exercise, genetics, hormones and beta-cells, those cells that produce insulin in your pancreas. Research shows that managing your diabetes early in the disease process can have big payoffs in later years. Joining a support group for people with diabetes can be helpful in keeping you going in your health quest. Following up with your health care team regularly and keeping abreast on the new developments in diabetes management can also benefit you.\n\n Answered by Andrea Dunn, RD, LD, CDE: Andrea Dunn is a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator with the Center for Human Nutrition." = "A: As you may have read, Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease.

"Q2: Do calories from hard liquor add just as much caloric energy/fat as calories from other sources? What are 'empty calories' so many people refer to?" = "Q2: Do calories from hard liquor add just as much caloric energy/fat as calories from other sources? What are 'empty calories' so many people refer to?";
"A: Excellent question. To make a long story short: A serving of alcohol is typically not very high in calories, BUT it is metabolized very differently than our food (90 percent in the liver), which can make weight loss tricky. For example, a light beer is roughly 100 calories and so is a handful of nuts. In terms of calories, this is not much at all, but in terms of metabolism, they vary significantly, partly because you have fiber, protein, and fat in the nut and virtually none of these in beer.\n 'This is why we can't say a calorie equals a calorie. Think of it this way, an empty calorie food or drink is something you can remove from the diet but still maintain optimal physiological function. Do our bodies need alcohol to survive? No. Candy? No. Soda? No. These are empty calories because they don't have a purpose. Do we need lean protein to survive? Yes. Fresh produce? Yes.

"Q4: Is there a genetic factor to strokes?" = "Q4: Is there a genetic factor to strokes?";
"A: Yes. There are genetic factors. There are some people that are born with certain genes that predispose them to stroke. One such condition would be CADASIL (cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). If you are interested, I am sure you can learn more about this condition from the Web. Some people are born with genetic conditions that predispose them to clotting. This in turn may increase their stroke risk. Finally, if you have a strong family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol or any of the major modifiable risk factors for stroke, you may also be at higher risk because of this.

"Q5: What medications are best for the treatment of asthma? What are their side effects?" = "Q5: What medications are best for the treatment of asthma? What are their side effects?";
"A: Albuterol is usually the primary 'rescue' or short-term medicine that is used to help acute asthma symptoms, such as coughing or wheezing. When a patient needs to use albuterol to relieve daytime symptoms more than twice per week, however, it usually reflects the need to use daily 'controller' or anti-inflammatory medications. Many people are concerned about possible side effects of inhaled steroids, which are the largest group of 'controller' medications available. When used in low- to medium-doses, however, inhaled steroids are very safe, even used on a daily basis for years. They are much safer than either multiple courses of oral steroids OR uncontrolled/undertreated asthma symptoms.\n\n Answered by John Carl, MD.

If so, what are they and what medications are implicated?";
"A: Many parents are concerned about the long-term effects of taking medicines. One of the best sources of information for this question is the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA). This study was a very large study of the treatments typically associated with ADHD, pharmacotherapy, behavioral intervention, and their combination. Evidence regarding the side effects of using stimulant treatment for ADHD shows that long-term use of medicine may decrease stature. However, in children who have continued use of medicine with generally higher doses of methylphenidate, stature differences remain relatively small. The use of stimulants to treat ADHD both in the short-term and long-term is considered safe by most of the major medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n Answered by Michael Manos, PhD.

"A: Typically, uterine fibroids would not cause bladder prolapse. However, they can certainly make the symptoms and/or the degree of prolapse worse, depending upon the size and location of the fibroid. It is also possible that a fibroid in the right location could actually cause the front wall of the vagina—where the bladder is—to protrude.

"A: Light color clothing makes you feel cooler because it reflects most of the sun rays. However, dark colors actually absorb the sun rays and helps to prevent the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from getting to the skin underneath the clothing. Therefore, dark-colored clothes are more protective against the sun than light-colored clothing in areas that are covered, but are not protective for the skin that is not covered by the dark clothing. Sunscreen is still recommended for those uncovered areas.\n 'In terms of spray tans, there are not known harmful side effects to the skin from them.

"Q12: What causes Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and what is the best method of treatment? Can iodine help this condition?" = "Q12: What causes Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and what is the best method of treatment? Can iodine help this condition?";
"A: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a type of autoimmune thyroid disease in which the immune system attacks and changes the texture of the thyroid gland. Hashimoto's thyroiditis stops the gland from making enough thyroid hormones for the body to work the way it should. Therefore often people will need thyroid hormone replacement. Levothyroxine replacement (T4) is used to treat Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, although there are other formulations such as Armour thyroid (which contain both T3 and T4), which is also sometimes used.\n 'One should avoid taking iodine in this situation.

"A: Greek yogurt typically has more protein than regular yogurt (about 16 gm. versus 6 gm.), but it is not necessarily more healthy. No matter what type of yogurt you choose, look for one that is fat-free or at least low-fat and that is not loaded with sugar. Plain yogurt will obviously not have added sugar; and, typically, yogurts that are 100 calories or less for a 6 oz. container will be moderate in added sugar.\n\n Answered by Maxine Smith, RD, LD.
